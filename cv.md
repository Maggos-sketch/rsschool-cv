## About me.

Hi! My name is Max. I live in Russia. I'm 19 y.o. and finishing college now.


I study on my own programming languages because I really want work as progarmmer. I believe that I can change the world, and I **won't give up**.
 
## Skills
+ SQL;

+ Django Framework;
+ C++;
+ JavaScript;
+ 1C.

## My code.
This is the code of the popular game. Rock-Paper-Scissors.
Here we can play with friends. All your results will be written to a file.

And there are more than Paper or Rock or Scissors :)

```Python
import random, os.path
players = {}
file_name = 'rating.txt'

def file_exist(file_):
    existing = os.path.isfile(file_)
    if not existing:
        file_cr = open(file_, 'w')
        file_cr.close()

def check(name):
    p = 0
    _file = open(file_name , 'r+')
    if name in _file.read():
       return f'Hello, {name}'
    else:
        print('\n'+name, p, file=_file)
        _file.close()
        return f'Hello, {name}'

def points():
    file_po = open(file_name, 'r')
    for line in file_po.readlines():
        name, score = line.split()
        players[name] = int(score)
    return players

def win(name):
    for ind, value in players.items():
        if name == ind:
            players[ind] = value + 100
    return players

def draw(name):
    for ind, value in players.items():
        if name == ind:
            players[ind] = value + 50
    return players
